<!-- # Instahack - A Massive instagram Bruteforce tool -->

## About Instahack

Instahack is a **Bash** and **Python-based** tool made to **test password strength** on Instagram accounts, using brute force techniques with Termux and Kali. It is designed to help users understand how weak passwords can be exploited and works by routing its activity through Tor for anonymity.

This tool is compatible with both rooted and non-rooted Android devices and can help users test their account security. **Instahack** was created by *Waseem Akram* and focuses on password testing for educational and ethical purposes. The tool is built using Bash and Python scripts.

## How Does Instahack Work?

Instahack leverages Tor to change IP addresses, bypassing Instagram‚Äôs login limits to test large wordlists against a user‚Äôs password. The goal of this tool is to demonstrate how a brute force attack can expose vulnerabilities in weak passwords, so users can better protect themselves.

Instahack mimics Instagram APK signatures to avoid detection and maintains progress during network interruptions, ensuring continuous testing. This script can test up to 6 million passwords on a single account with minimal resources. However, improper Tor setup could leave users exposed, so proper configuration is essential.

## How to Protect Your Instagram Account

### Tips to Strengthen Your Password:

* Use a long password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
* Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on Instagram to add an extra layer of security.
* Avoid using common or easily guessable passwords.

### Why Weak Passwords Get Hacked:

Hackers use brute force attacks, like the ones simulated by Instahack, to test millions of password combinations in a short time. If your password is weak or commonly used, it could be cracked quickly.

To keep your account safe, regularly update your password and avoid reusing the same password across multiple sites.

### Additional Security Measures:

* Regularly update your password and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.
* Be cautious of phishing emails or messages that may attempt to steal your login credentials.
* Monitor your account activity for any suspicious logins or unauthorized access.
* Report any suspicious activity to Instagram and change your password immediately.
* Stay informed about the latest security threats and best practices to protect your account.

By following these security tips and staying vigilant, you can help safeguard your Instagram account from potential hacking attempts. Remember, protecting your online presence is essential in today‚Äôs digital age.

Stay safe and secure online!üîíüõ°Ô∏è
